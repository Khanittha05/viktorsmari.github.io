I have a few Raspberry Pies I use to do the following:

* Take pictures and create a timelapse 
* Monitor the environment (humidity, temp) along with the usual (RAM, CPU)

I use Ansible plays for setup and Munin to display the values on a graph.

*Here is a graph of air pressure from Munin.*

This Rasp is using DHT11 sensor to monitor humidity and temperature. The results are sent back using a munin-agent plugin I wrote.
It also takes pictures triggered with a cronjob every 30 minutes.
The images are then rsync-ed from a remote computer which creates a timelapse movie.

*This was a Arduino test, detecting light and temperature and printing it out on a LCD display*

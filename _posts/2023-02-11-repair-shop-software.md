In 2017 I started working on [software for repair shops](https://repero.me){:target="_blank"}


A family member was running a repair shop, both selling and repairing bicycles and scooters and needed a
system to manage all of the repair tickets.

The first version was written in 2012 by a friend using **PHP and MySQL** but after my degree in computer science,
I re-wrote the system using the **Ruby on Rails** web framework.

Our first version in 2017 did a few basic things, it could
- Create customers
- Create bicycles
- Create tickets

We needed a name for it, and went with [Repero](https://repero.me){:target="_blank"}

Then we started adding more features like:
- Sending emails from the system
- Sending SMS from the system
- Make PDF invoices
- Upload photos of your repair
- Allow your clients to view the status of their repair using a link

Then we made sure that the system works for all kinds of repair shops. Now we have customers that repair for example:
- Computers and phones
- Cars
- Watches & jewelry
- & more..

We have a list of some of the features here:
[repero.me features](https://repero.me/features){:target="_blank"}

We also have some advanced features like:
- Send Webhooks to another system

We work closely with our customers and receive great feedback on what to add next to the system.
Some ideas include:
- Clock in / clock out system
- Better statistics on how many repairs each worker completes
- How much time each repair spends in a given status / state

If you run a repair shop and need software, you can sign up for free here:
[repero.me/users/sign_up](https://repero.me/users/sign_up){:target="_blank"}

We have a free plan that you can use **forever** and you don't need a credit card.

### Orihuela Costa

Many foreigners live in Orihuela Costa.
These are often people from northern Europe that are used to biking, and you can see people over 65 riding their bikes around the area.


In the La Zenia shopping mall, we see this sign about the benefits of biking

The road **Ctra. de Villamart√≠n**, from La Zenia to Villamartin (in the North West) has a bridge over **AP7**.

The bridge has a mixed bicycle / pedestrian lane which ends suddenly like this:

The bridge over N332 can only fit 1 person.
If you meet someone on the ramp, you have to wait your turn.

All over the place you can find these painted bicycle signs on the street.

Are they useful?

Do they provide security to bicyclists?

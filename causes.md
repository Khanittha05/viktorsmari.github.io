Here are some causes I care about:

#### Basic Income
* Give everyone a basic salary so they have a safety net, and can follow their passion.

#### Bicycle infrastructure (and public transport)
* Give people the opportunity to not having to own a car, but still travel fast and securely.

#### Online democracy
* Be able to vote on **some** issues online, not all, since online voting will *never* be 100% secure.

* Examples:
  * [The Icelandic Pirate Party](https://x.piratar.is/polity/1/) made its own voting system. See [Github](https://github.com/piratar/wasa2il)
  * [Decidim](https://decidim.org) - Open source participatory democracy for cities and organizations.


#### Shorter working week
* We have not in our lifetime seen so much progress in efficiency (Internet, Robots, AI, Machine Learning), still the work week has not changed in many years (depending on country).
* 1971 - Iceland, law on a 40 hour work week was set, and still stands today.
* [German union fights for 28 work week](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/four-day-working-week-german-union-28-hours-uk-fight-for-the-same-a7996261.html)

#### Sustainable living
**I try to:**

* travel using my own energy
* buy items without packaging. - Who needs a banana wrapped in plastic?
* buy items created closeby, not on the other side of the world
* reduce meat consumption
* eat seasonal food

#### Recycling
* [EU declares war on plastic before 2030](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/16/eu-declares-war-on-plastic-waste-2030)

#### Simpler tax system
* Do you know a person who can accurately do their taxes?

#### Free education
* In Denmark, students [get paid](http://www.su.dk/english/) to go to school for ~4 years

#### Free healthcare
* In Denmark, healthcare is free.
